    <h4 id="what-is-mobile-friendly">What is a mobile friendly web application?</h4>
    <div class="ml-2">
      <p>A mobile friendly web application is <strong>a website created such that its content is viewable in an
          acceptable way on a mobile device</strong>. For example changing two side by side images on a large screen to
        be one above the other on a small screen. Or possibly adjusting font size to better fit your display.</p>
      <p>Since it is a website it <strong>must be accessed from a web browser</strong>. It is not an application you can
        install on a device.</p>
      <p>Being mobile friendly means <strong>you will be able to successfully use the site on any device of your
          choosing</strong>. That does not mean all devices are equal for all tasks (see the next question).</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Isn't it hard to enter free text (comments, etc.) on a mobile device?</h4>
    <div class="ml-2">
      <p>It can be, yes. This is a matter of personal preferene and your comfort level with the device in question. Many
        people are perfectly comfortable holding long conversations via text on their phone. Others can't stand a mobile
        keyboard.</p>
      <p>However, since the new application is just a webite <strong>the choice of device for each task is entirely up
          to you</strong>. If you are comfortable on mobile, go for it. If you'd rather use a desktop screen and full
        keyboard you can do so. You may find that certain forms will be easy on mobile and others will need a desktop.
        This will be entirely your choice.</p>
      <p>Additionally, many phones now support speech to text options. This allows you to speak to the phone and it will
        translate your comments into text. This is another option for entering comments.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Can a question display differently on different forms?</h4>
    <div class="ml-2">
      <p>The format in which a question displays depends entirely on the type of question. A question type will display
        exactly the same way on every form. Bearing in mind of course there may be additional text wrapping, etc. on
        small screens as part of being mobile friendly.</p>
      <p><strong>You will not be able to request custom displays for individual questions on specific forms.</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Are choices made now about question display permanent? Are they set in stone?</h4>
    <div class=ml-2>
      <p>Yes and no. There will be plenty of opportunity to make tweaks to how questions display and behave going
        forward. However once development starts in earnest there will not be an opportunity to do so in the near term
        due to the focus on core application development.</p>
